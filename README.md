# NoServer
Solves every bug, ever, for any Paper server.

## How does it work?
By employing the use of advanced philosophical-programmatic thinking, we have
reached the conclusion that the least-buggy server is no server. Rather than
attempting to fix the symptoms of glitches, lag, or non-functional features,
this plugin destroys the issues at their root by destroying the server.

## Should I install this on my server?
Absolutely ~~not~~.
